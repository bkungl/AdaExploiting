# System Storage Pool
When dynamic memory is requested in Ada, there are two routes: using a user-defined storage pool or using a provided system storage pool. This folder contains code of using dynamic memory of the system storage pool. The system storage pool is only limited in size to available memory so the system storage pool is located on the heap. Attacks in this folder focus on heap-based exploits and attacking dynamic memory on the heap.
